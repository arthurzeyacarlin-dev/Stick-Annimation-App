# Session Handoff

Status: canonical last-known stopping point
Last updated: 2026-08-31
Active Approved/Verified specs: `docs/specs/0001-first-reversible-ai-stick-animation.md`, `docs/specs/0002-lossless-local-drawing-save-and-reopen.md`, and `docs/specs/0003-tutorials-and-cleaner-home-screen.md`
Current result: SPEC-0003's one product implementation is fully Verified, published, and integrated through D-0032 in exact commit `9fa1b819aacc7823711af5838b79e70921469a93`. No next feature is selected, authorized, or started.
Current roadmap phase: Phase 0 — Preserve and Stabilize

## Current SPEC-0003 Result

The D-0031 permanent-tester prerequisite plus reviewed records are published/integrated in exact canonical-main commit `2cd25fd0bdfb8a775370641ffd65db315cc94532`, parent `57ef6ff5ff9d2da7ca3ab1e154aac9f506cc6b81`, message `Update permanent tester for SPEC-0003`. The corrected clean permanent tester passed before the product executor edited, and that exact commit became the product base.

One dedicated Spec Executor completed the exact ten-path product implementation, proved it, returned its packet, and stopped. Arthur reviewed the local app copy and explicitly accepted it. The Project Manager accepted the recovered technical result and transferred exclusive ownership of `/Users/arthurcarlin/.codex/worktrees/f1a4/stick-animation-app` to the Control Plane Architect. After reviewed propagation and separate publication authorization, the Control Plane Architect published the exact ten technical paths plus ten reviewed control-plane paths in commit `9fa1b819aacc7823711af5838b79e70921469a93`, parent `2cd25fd0bdfb8a775370641ffd65db315cc94532`, message `Implement SPEC-0003 Tutorials screen`.

The accepted visible result is:

- Home Tutorials opens a polished full-screen dark-navy/blue Tutorials page.
- The Home header is absent inside Tutorials.
- The only `h1` is `Welcome to Diamond Animator`.
- One dominant blue-outlined `Start Here` card appears first.
- Three smaller cards follow in exact order: `Create Your First Animation`, `Create with AI`, and `Finalize Your Animation`.
- All four cards say `COMING LATER` and are static/non-interactive.
- Back returns Home and restores focus to the Home Tutorials card.
- The inert Home AI Credits card is removed.

## Exact Accepted Technical Boundary

The accepted product/proof paths are exactly:

- `app/page.tsx`
- `src/components/tutorials/TutorialsScreen.tsx`
- `src/components/tutorials/TutorialsScreen.module.css`
- `src/lib/tutorials/tutorialCatalog.ts`
- `scripts/fixtures/spec0003-tutorials/v1/browser-plan.json`
- `scripts/fixtures/spec0003-tutorials/v1/proof-commands.json`
- `scripts/spec0003-tutorials/browserProofContract.ts`
- `scripts/runSpec0003TutorialsBrowserProof.ts`
- `scripts/recordSpec0003TutorialsProof.ts`
- `scripts/validateSpec0003TutorialsProof.ts`

The publication commit contains exactly these 20 paths: the ten accepted paths above, plus `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/changelog.md`, `docs/specs/0003-tutorials-and-cleaner-home-screen.md`, `docs/specs/README.md`, `docs/testing_workflow.md`, and `project/project_structure.txt`.

The fresh technical manifest is `output/spec-0003/single-implementation/proof-manifest.json`, 3,084 bytes, SHA-256 `4b63e1dc171cf9536aecbed067f271793dffc17137200afc8d136e1072d04d6d`. Independent validation passes with six receipts and four artifacts. Its browser result covers `1440×900`, `1024×768`, and `390×844`; three screenshots; 14 assertion groups; exact copy/order/geometry/static semantics; Back/focus; no overflow; zero console/page errors; and zero API/external requests. TypeScript, focused lint, and both diff checks pass. Full lint remains the accepted 5-error/72-warning baseline with no accepted changed-path finding.

The original accepted output was erased before recovery. The regenerated screenshots and manifest prove the same exact replayed source result but are not claimed byte-identical to the historical manifest whose SHA-256 began `1059c0…`. The ten accepted product/proof source paths were hash-frozen on takeover and remained unchanged through Control Plane Architect propagation, publication, and final reconciliation.

## Durable Git and Lifecycle Record

- publication worktree/branch used: `/Users/arthurcarlin/.codex/worktrees/f1a4/stick-animation-app`, `codex/spec0003-publication`
- exact product publication: commit `9fa1b819aacc7823711af5838b79e70921469a93`, parent `2cd25fd0bdfb8a775370641ffd65db315cc94532`, message `Implement SPEC-0003 Tutorials screen`, exactly 20 reviewed paths
- immediately after product publication: publication branch, canonical local `main`, local `origin/main`, and live GitHub `main` matched at `9fa1b819…`; both relevant worktrees were clean; canonical synchronization was `0/0`
- SPEC-0003 implementation: Verified, published, and integrated
- clean committed permanent tester: PASS with 40 operations, 13 screenshots, 4 driver messages, all 37 historical negatives, four ordered Stick GETs, one Drawing POST, zero real-route/non-loopback/provider requests, and cleanup; result SHA-256 `8c3647aecec11f2660c5bc47b2e656da6fc1b19b816c9a317c709d759f661412`; ledger SHA-256 `514d163f272a938a7babb374cda98ea5f362a36f5566ee0e34afbab4db1130ac`
- final record-only closeout: exactly eight canonical documents and no product/proof path; its own commit SHA and present staging/branch/main/origin/live state are deliberately not embedded and must be verified directly from Git
- exact record-only closeout paths: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/changelog.md`, `docs/specs/0003-tutorials-and-cleaner-home-screen.md`, `docs/specs/README.md`, and `docs/testing_workflow.md`
- deployment, provider/external/paid work, and next-feature work: not performed

## Stopping Point

There is no implementation handoff and no next product milestone is selected. Any future task must run the required repository boot and verify current Git refs directly rather than treating product publication SHA `9fa1b819…` as the repository's permanent current HEAD. Stop until Arthur selects the next milestone.

SPEC-0001 Phase 7 remains separate and Unauthorized/Not started. Real tutorial media/playback, AI Assistant, Export, AI Project Finalizer, My Project behavior, and every other future Home feature remain unauthorized/not started.

## Proven and Not Proven

Proven: exact accepted base and ten-path scope; executor shutdown and exclusive transfer; Arthur/PM acceptance; visible Tutorials result at all three required viewports; static-card semantics; Back/focus; Home AI Credits removal; manifest/hash revalidation; TypeScript/focused-lint/diff evidence; zero API/external requests; accepted-byte preservation; exact 20-path product commit and parent; clean committed permanent tester pass; safe canonical-main fast-forward and normal push; immediate post-product-publication branch/local-main/origin/live-GitHub SHA equality, clean worktrees, and `0/0` synchronization; and an exact eight-document record-only closeout with no product/proof change.

Not performed: deployment, real tutorial media, or any next feature. The current commit, index, branch, main, origin, and live-GitHub state are operational facts to verify directly from Git and are not frozen into this handoff.

## Systems Intentionally Left Unchanged

Home masthead/header/menu/notification and every retained Home card; New Project; Open Project; My Project; Home AI Assistant; Export; AI Project Finalizer; Drawing; Stick; Creator; timelines; AI panels; save/open; undo/redo; SPEC-0001 Phases 1–6; SPEC-0002; SPEC-0001 Phase 7 authorization; fonts and global styles; packages/dependencies/configuration/environment/database/public assets/deployment; external/provider/paid services; other worktrees; and recovery material remain unchanged.
