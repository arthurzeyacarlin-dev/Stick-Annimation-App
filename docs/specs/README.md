# Specification Index and Lifecycle

Status: canonical spec registry
Last updated: 2026-08-09

## Active Spec

None. The initial control-plane task intentionally did not choose the first product/engineering behavior change.

The next task must either:

- create and approve one spec from `TEMPLATE.md`, then name it in `../SESSION_HANDOFF.md`; or
- perform a read-only discussion/audit that does not change behavior.

Recommended first candidate: a safe repository baseline and regression-harness spec covering Git preservation, canonical commands, offline validators, and browser smoke tests. Arthur may instead choose a product behavior priority.

## Provisionally Promoted Legacy References

| Spec | Status | Authority and caveat |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `../../diamond-animator-docs/02_animation_engine/MOTION_TWEEN_SYSTEM.md` | Provisionally promoted legacy V1 intent; implementation present; owner confirmation and current verification pending | Best detailed inherited reference for drawing position-only motion tween, not a newly approved spec. Full acceptance was not rerun on 2026-08-09. Latest user direction and accepted superseding decisions prevail; any code/spec mismatch must be recorded and reconciled before changing either. |

No file under `diamond-animator-docs/` is currently an approved implementation specification. The row above is a mandatory reconciliation reference only.

## File Naming

New specs use:

```text
docs/specs/NNNN-short-kebab-case-title.md
```

Numbers are monotonic and never reused. The first new spec is `0001-...`.

## Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Being researched; no implementation authorization |
| Proposed | Goal/scope/proof ready for PM decision |
| Approved | Arthur or the current explicit task authorized implementation |
| In progress | Implementation and verification loop is active |
| Implemented | Code is patched, but required verification is not complete |
| Verified | Acceptance and regression gates passed; control plane updated |
| Blocked | Cannot proceed within current authority after the required blocked threshold/process |
| Superseded | Replaced by a named newer spec/decision |
| Abandoned | Deliberately stopped; reason preserved |

Only one spec should be `In progress` unless independent concurrency is documented in both specs and the handoff.

## Promotion Rules

A design note becomes an approved spec only when it contains:

- exact user goal and current problem
- evidence from live code/behavior
- explicit scope and non-goals
- real execution path and data/state impact
- exact user action sequence
- measurable acceptance criteria
- protected regression boundaries
- cost/security/privacy/dependency impact
- required verification commands and real-app flows
- status, owner/decision link, and last verified date/commit

Thin architecture prose, chat logs, paste packs, TODO entries, code comments, and test scripts are not specs by themselves.

## Required End-of-Spec Updates

When a spec reaches Verified:

1. add its final evidence and exact files changed
2. update `../CURRENT_STATE.md`
3. close/move its `../TODO.md` IDs
4. append `../changelog.md`
5. record durable choices in `../DECISIONS.md`
6. update this index and `../SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
7. run the control-plane and relevant code gates

Do not mark Verified when any required acceptance flow remains unproven.
